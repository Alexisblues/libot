# Operational Transform library!

> This is very much a work in progress. Only the text type is implemented so far. I want to add the new JSON type soon, but I'm waiting for the javascript version to be stable.

This is a little OT library for native applications. The types here should mirror their friends in [ottypes](https://github.com/ottypes).

## Dependancies

libOT depends on [librope](https://github.com/josephg/librope). The makefile assumes librope can be found at `../librope`.
