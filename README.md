# Operational Transform library!

This is a little OT library for native applications. The types here should
mirror their friends in [ot-types](https://github.com/share/ot-types).

This project may be merged with ot-types at some point.

## Dependancies

libOT depends on [librope](https://github.com/josephg/librope). The makefile assumes librope can be found at `../librope`.
